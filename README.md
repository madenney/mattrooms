### The Social Media Platform

This project has two motivations: 
1. This is intended to be a demonstration of my skill as a full stack developer.
2. I want to be in full control of my communication platform, so I will use this as my primary method of communication.

This was built following a Test-Driven Development philosophy. Every component is modular and individually unit-tested.
